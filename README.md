# WEBINARS CATALOG – Server Side

This application was built as part of a Technical Case for a Junior Full Stack Web Developer position.  
The objective was to build a Webinar Catalog Application where users can browse webinars and enroll by submitting a form with name, email, and LinkedIn URL.

## 🚀 Running Locally

Run the commands below in a Git Bash terminal:

```bash
mkdir server
cd server
git clone https://github.com/victorgfz/webinars_catalog_server.git .
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file and configure the environment variables:

```
DATABASE_URL=
CORS_ORIGIN=
JWT_SECRET=
```

Then run:

```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev
npm run dev
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

I decided to use the **MVC pattern adapted to REST APIs**, which I believe is the most common approach in this context and also the one I am most comfortable with.  
The MVC pattern separates the application into specific layers:

- **Routes**: define endpoints and call the corresponding controllers.
- **Middlewares**: intercept requests for certain validations (e.g., authentication).
- **Controllers**: receive the HTTP request, pass the necessary data to the services, and then send back a JSON response.
- **Services**: responsible for executing business rules, usually persisting or retrieving data from the database.

## 📚 API Routes

### 🔐 Authentication

- `POST /auth/register` → register a new user
- `POST /auth/login` → log in the user
- `POST /auth/logout` → log out the user

### 👤 User

- `GET /user` → returns info about the logged-in user

### 🗂️ Filters

- `GET /filter` → returns the list of available filters for webinars
- `GET /filter/categories` → returns the list of categories
- `GET /filter/speakers` → returns the list of speakers
- `POST /filter/categories` → creates a new category in the database
- `POST /filter/speakers` → creates a new speaker in the database

### 📺 Webinars

- `GET /webinar` → returns the list of webinars (can receive query strings for filtering)
- `GET /webinar/:id` → returns the info of a specific webinar by its id
- `POST /webinar/:id/enrollment` → creates a new enrollment for a specific webinar
- `POST /webinar` → creates a new webinar in the database

### ➕ Extra Routes

These routes are not part of the required functionalities, but I decided to implement them since no API was provided to fetch the necessary data, and this approach avoids having to insert them manually:

- `POST /webinar`
- `GET /filter/categories`
- `GET /filter/speakers`
- `POST /filter/categories`
- `POST /filter/speakers`
